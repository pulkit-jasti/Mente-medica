# Mente-Medica
Welcome to the repository of the project Mente-Medica by team Bit_Bots. :green_heart: ![Project logo](https://github.com/lakshmisaibhargavi/mente_medica/blob/master/Pics/logo.png)

### Do check out our [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM8Tx5-XfMI&rel=0) video

Before you start running your mind to guess what does the project name even mean :thinking: (which is a great mental exercise BTW: blue_book:), we would like to share little statistics related to Mental Health with you -

![Statistics](https://github.com/lakshmisaibhargavi/mente_medica/blob/master/Pics/stats.png)

Of course, there is more to this data than this part of the table shows, but the question is, would you care to read it?

The complete data can be found [here](https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health)

# Why should you care?

Because even if you are in a happy state of mind, you should care because your loved ones can have to deal with mental disorders. You should care because you live in a society and human beings are a social animal thriving due to each other's support. Gun violence, terrorism, and Suicide can all be traced back to some sort of mental sickness :pensive:. 

And then you want to live in a happier world, don't you?

# How does our solution fit into all this?

We researched and found out that our lifestyle plays a colossal role in our mental health. Enjoying life, Physical exercises, Yoga, Food, Music, and even the content you consume plays a hefty role in how you feel in your life; in the long run, it decides your mental state, success, and happiness in a relationship. As long as these elements maintain that sweet spot in your lifestyle, you might never even face any mental health issues and if you are facing some already, they will help you to come out of it quickly.

Ha, we know that you have already heard that somewhere, so let's get to the point! :ok_woman:

We built you a buddy or a girlfriend/boyfriend (only if you are single XD) which will always be present for you, right in your mobile. Someone who won't judge you, rather just show you the coolest things on Earth (and maybe Neptune as well; could get too cold), someone that will teach you good habits like exercising, eating a healthy diet and laughing. But whatever it does, it will be selflessly present to improve the quality of your life. :sunflower:

# What makes it more awesome than the other Habit tracker apps?

Yes, you'll find some apps on Playstore and Appstore that try to solve this problem, but they are not able to fully accomplish it. Either they are too dull to be of any help in cheering up the user or they are so monotonous that the user has do download several of them. 

Our app makes use of Machine Learning to make all the selections for you according to your mood just like your best friend does :) This app also provides an all in one experience by not just telling you what to do but also how to do it, because it works on the power of databases from verified sources.

Start your day with Yoga and exercise then treat yourself to a healthy breakfast and then maybe have fun with some inspiring stories and mind soothing music. Not to mention that you can enjoy memes and jokes as well on the app. :sun_with_face:

# How did we build it? :wrench:

**Hardware** - Only your mobile! That's what makes it so practical and scalable. Just install the app and feel the power.

**Programming Languages** - Dart.

**Tools** - Flutter, TensorFlow.



# Challenges we ran into - :disappointed_relieved:

We faced the challenge of achieving the maximum accuracy in our mood detector and therefore get the dynamic content according to the mood. We were trying to find a Machine Learning solution that can help us do this and thus decided to use a pre-trained TensorFlow Light.

# Features in the Future - :yum:

We plan to add a live face recognition feature that will automatically detect the user's mood from their facial expression and provide a more dynamic content based on the changing mood of the user.
